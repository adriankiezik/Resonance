# Viewport Implementation Status

## âœ… All Tasks Complete!

The sample scene rendering is now fully implemented and working.

### Completed Tasks

1. âœ… Shader updated to match engine format (view, projection, view_projection)
2. âœ… Vertex format updated (position, normal, uv, color)
3. âœ… Grid mesh UV coordinates added
4. âœ… Scene object struct created
5. âœ… Camera uniform format updated in both locations (new() and update_camera())
6. âœ… create_scene_objects() method implemented
7. âœ… Scene objects initialized in ViewportRenderer::new()
8. âœ… Render loop updated to draw scene objects
9. âœ… **Camera orientation fixed** - This was the critical fix!
10. âœ… UI transparency configured
11. âœ… Build successful
12. âœ… Testing complete

## The Key Fix

The main issue was the **camera orientation**. The camera was initially looking horizontally at Y=2 height, but the cubes were at Y=0.5. The camera needed to be repositioned and oriented to look down at the scene.

**Before:**
```rust
position: Vec3::new(0.0, 2.0, 5.0),
rotation: Quat::IDENTITY,  // Looking straight ahead
```

**After:**
```rust
let position = Vec3::new(5.0, 5.0, 8.0);
let target = Vec3::ZERO;
// Calculate rotation to look at target
let rotation = Quat::from_mat3(...);
```

## Testing

Run the editor:
```bash
cd ferrite_editor
npm run tauri:dev
```

You should now see:
- âœ… 5 colored cubes (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta)
- âœ… Proper lighting with directional light
- âœ… Working camera controls (Alt+drag to orbit, middle-drag to pan, scroll to zoom)
- âœ… Camera info overlay
- âœ… Dark blue/gray wgpu-rendered background
